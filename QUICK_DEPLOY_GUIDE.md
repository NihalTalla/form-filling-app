# Quick Deployment Guide for Your Form Application

## 🚀 Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway

### Prepare Your Project
1. **Create Railway Account**: Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Connect GitHub**: Link your GitHub account
3. **Upload Project**: Push your `demo` folder to a GitHub repository

### Deploy to Railway
1. **Create New Project** in Railway
2. **Add MySQL Database**:
   - Click "New" → "Database" → "MySQL"
   - Railway will create a database with credentials
3. **Deploy Backend**:
   - Click "New" → "GitHub Repo" → Select your repository
   - Set Root Directory: `backend`
   - Railway auto-detects Node.js

### Configure Environment Variables
Add these in Railway backend service settings:
```
DB_HOST=mysql.railway.internal (Railway provides this)
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=(Railway generates this)
DB_NAME=railway
DB_PORT=3306
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### Your Backend URL
After deployment, Railway gives you a URL like:
`https://your-backend-railway.up.railway.app`

## 🌐 Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

### Prepare Frontend
1. **Update Environment**: In your `frontend/.env.production` file:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-railway.up.railway.app
```

### Deploy to Vercel
1. **Create Vercel Account**: Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. **Import Project**: Connect your GitHub repository
3. **Configure Build**:
   - Framework Preset: `Vite`
   - Root Directory: `frontend`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`

### Your Frontend URL
Vercel gives you a URL like:
`https://your-app-vercel.app`

## 🌍 Step 3: Connect Your GoDaddy Domain

### In Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your project → **Settings** → **Domains**
2. Add your domain: `yourdomain.com`
3. Vercel will show you DNS records to add

### In GoDaddy
1. **Login to GoDaddy** → **My Products** → **Domains**
2. **Manage DNS** for your domain
3. **Add DNS Records** as shown by Vercel:
   - **A Record**: `@` → `76.76.19.61` (Vercel's IP)
   - **CNAME**: `www` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`

### Wait for Propagation
- DNS changes take 10 minutes to 24 hours
- Check status in Vercel dashboard

---

## ✅ Step 4: Test Your Live Application

Once DNS propagates:
1. **Visit your domain**: `https://yourdomain.com`
2. **Fill out the form** with test data
3. **Verify submission** works end-to-end
4. **Check database** in Railway dashboard

---

## 🔧 Current Project Status

Your application is already running locally:
- ✅ **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- ✅ **Backend**: http://localhost:3001  
- ✅ **Database**: MySQL `demo` database

Ready for deployment with minimal configuration changes!

## 💡 Alternative: All-in-One Railway Deployment

If you prefer everything in one place:
1. **Deploy both frontend and backend to Railway**
2. **Use Railway's built-in domain**
3. **Point GoDaddy domain to Railway**

This approach costs ~$5/month but simplifies management.
